# Forming a New York Limited Liability Company (LLC)

## Articles of Organization

The *Articles of Organization* is a document that must be filed with the New York Department of State's Division of Corporations to form a LLC. The Articles must contain the following information:

+ The name of the company, which must contain "LLC" or a similar variant. 
+ The New York county where the LLC's principal office is located (e.g., Monroe County).
+ The address where a copy of any service of legal process against the LLC (such as a lawsuit) should be mailed to. (Service itself is made to the New York Secretary of State.)
+ The name and mailing address of the person filing the Articles, who does not have to be a member of the LLC itself.
+ The filing for an Articles of Organization is $200, payable to the Department of State.

## Certificate of Publication

+ A notice related to the filing of the Articles of Organizzation must be published in 2 newspapers for 6 consecutive weeks. The specific newspapers are designated by the county clerk for the county where the LLC's principal business office is located. For example, [Monroe County has designated 7 newspapers that may be used](https://www.monroecounty.gov/clerk-publications). Each newspaper charges its own publication fees.
+ A separate [Certificate of Publication](https://dos.ny.gov/certificate-publication-domestic-limited-liability-company-0) must be filed with the Secretary of State, together with affidavits from the 2 newspapers confirming publication of the notices, and a $50 filing fee. 
+ The Certificate of Publication must be filed within 120 days (~4 months) of filing the Articles of Organization.

## Operating Agreement

+ The Operating Agreement is a written contract between the members of the LLC. An LLC must have at least 1 member. New York law requires the LLC to adopt a written operating agreement, although there is no actual penalty for failing to do so. The Operating Agreement is **not** filed with the Secretary of State. 
+ The Operating Agreement may be signed before, during, or within 90 days after the filing of the Articles of Organization.
+ Common provisions of an Operating Agreement include:
	* The specific business purpose of the LLC.
	* The duration of the LLC, i.e., whether it will dissolve on or by a certain date.
	* Who will manage the LLC if there is more than 1 member.
	* If there is more than 1 member, each member's respective ownership interests in the LLC.
	* Any provisions for conducting a vote among the members.
	* How members may be compensated for work performed for the LLC.
	* When and where the members will have regular meetings, if any, or how the members may call special meetings.
	* How the LLC will be classified for tax purposes (see below).
	* The LLC's tax year and accounting method.
	* The capital contributions of each member (i.e., what assets they will contribute to the LLC in exchange for their ownership interest).
	* Provisions for the deal or withdrawal of a member and the transfer of any membership interests.
	* Provisions for electing or appointing officers of the LLC, such as President or Treasurer.
	* The Agreement must be signed by all members.

## Internal Revenue Service Filings

+ The IRS will treat a single-member LLC as a sole proprietorship for federal income tax purposes. Similarly, a multi-member LLC is treated as a general partnership. The LLC may elect in its Operating Agreement to be treated as a corporation instead, although this is uncommon.
+ A sole member will report the LLC's activities on their personal income tax return as business income (Form 1040, Schedule C). A multi-member LLC treated as a partnership will file a separate return specifically for partnerships, [Form 1065](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1065). 
+ Regardless of classification, the LLC should obtain its own federal employer identification number (EIN), by filing a [Form SS-4](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-ss-4). There is no charge for this filing.
